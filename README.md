# FuturesMarket-Prediction

Our target is to predict what the futures market would be like in the coming future. 
The original dataset provided is a real-life futures trading messages collected by some platform.
Related data reflecting the market such as the current price and volume are sampled by every half second. 
The data can be fully utilized to learn its pattern so as to predict the future situation in the market.
Many ML methods are attempted and compared, including classical methods and deep learning methods. 

Frameworks Scikit-learn and Keras are used in our work.
